        <b> John Hay</b> (1838-1905) was an American statesman and official whose career in government stretched
        over
        almost half
        a century. After graduation from Brown University in 1858, Hay read law in his uncle's office in Springfield,
        Illinois, adjacent to that of Abraham Lincoln. Hay worked for Lincoln's successful presidential campaign, and
        became his assistant private secretary. Through the American Civil War, Hay was close to Lincoln, and stood by
        his deathbed after Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theatre. In 1897, President William McKinley made him the
        ambassador to Britain. The following year, Hay became the U.S. secretary of state. He served almost seven years,
        first under McKinley before his assassination, and then under Theodore Roosevelt. Hay was responsible for the
        Open Door Policy in China.
